# Bookings Classification
# Abstract:
Our goal for this Classification Model is to predict the individuals that are
going to cancel their hotel booking, we will take the (canceled or not) as
our dependent value and the number of adults, children and babies,
Country, repeated customer, number of nights and more as our
independent value. This model will help us identify which type of people
cancel their booking more, we got our data form Kaggle, we used a lot of
libraries to clean, visualize and analyze to come up with the best model
possible. 

# Dataset:
We plan to get our data form Kaggle website, and we will have around 100,000 data points.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87317718/146173290-3545f12d-00e4-4b0e-988c-683a2d61e598.png)
